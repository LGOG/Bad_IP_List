### About the Flagged IP List

The `Flagged IP.csv` file produced by this script is a carefully curated compilation of IP addresses identified for engaging in harmful activities, such as cyber-attacks, spamming, and other security threats. This list amalgamates data from trusted and authoritative sources within the cybersecurity realm, ensuring a robust tool for network defense.
